# 1.Self-introduction

```markdown
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to introduce myself.

Good afternoon! I’m XXX, and I’m excited to be here for this interview.

I hold a bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Hefei University and have over six years of experience as a Data Engineer. I am proficient in key data engineering technologies, including Hadoop, Spark, and Hive, and have more than three years of experience working with AWS cloud-based solutions. Additionally, I have extensive experience in optimizing data processing performance.

One of the most significant experiences in my career was working as a Data Engineer on eBay’s Shanghai Data Warehouse team for the past three years. During this time, my primary focus was on data integration for both the commercial and product domains. In addition, I contributed to several key projects, including data governance initiatives and performance tuning for data processing jobs in the production environment. These experiences strengthened my problem-solving skills and enhanced my ability to optimize large-scale data workflows.

Due to a strategic restructuring, eBay decided to close its Shanghai office, which is why I am currently seeking new opportunities.

I believe my skills and experience align well with this position, and I am confident that my expertise can bring value to your team. I’m very much looking forward to the opportunity to contribute.

Thank you!

# 2.Project introduction

## 1.CDP

```
Certainly. In my previous role, we worked on a project called the "Consolidated Data Product" (CDP) with tight deadlines. The project was initiated because multiple European branches had inconsistent data definitions, which made it difficult for senior management to get a clear and unified view of overall operations. To address this, we proposed building a unified data product to standardize key KPIs, optimize data analysis dimensions, and enable more efficient decision-making.

The data sources for the KPIs included the existing DWD-level tables from our global data warehouse, as well as data from local business databases of the branches. We used Spark as the processing engine, and the final metrics were visualized through Tableau dashboards.

My primary responsibility in this project was calculating all key metrics for the Transaction and Advertising domains. During the requirements analysis phase, we worked closely with the business team to define the KPIs and align on the business logic behind them. After gaining a clear understanding of the business logic, I translated it into precise technical specifications. I also contributed to designing the data warehouse architecture, data processing flows, and ensuring the processes were efficient.

However, we encountered some significant performance issues during the development phase. To address these challenges, I focused on optimizing the data processing pipeline. Specifically, I adjusted resource allocation for the tasks and optimized key operations such as the COUNT DISTINCT function. These optimizations led to a dramatic reduction in task runtime, from 6 hours down to 1 hour.

Additionally, I implemented a comprehensive data quality management process. This involved adding validation tasks to ensure the data met key quality standards such as timeliness, accuracy, completeness, consistency, and uniqueness throughout the pipeline.

This project was both challenging and rewarding. It not only enhanced my technical skills across AWS, BigQuery, Spark, and Tableau, but it also sharpened my ability to collaborate effectively with business stakeholders.

I’m excited about the possibility of bringing my skills and experience to your team and contributing to your goals. Thank you!

## 2.Data governance

```
Project Background:
The goal of the project was to ensure efficient, secure, compliant, and valuable management of organizational data to support data-driven decision-making and business operations. By improving data quality, ensuring data security, maintaining compliance, and enhancing data availability, data governance helps maximize the value of data while minimizing the associated risks and costs.

Responsibilities and Key Tasks:

Metadata Management:

I built a metadata management framework to address the large number of unstructured and unlayered tables in the data warehouse. My tasks included:

Designing and implementing a data processing workflow to collect and maintain metadata for all tables in the platform.
Creating a dictionary table containing detailed information such as table names, fields, partitions, table types, business attributes, storage paths, table sizes, data lineage, associated processes, development owner (Dev Owner), and project manager (PM Owner).
Developing an integration data flow for a Data Asset (DA) management tool that requires any new table to be reviewed and approved via GitHub before it can be created. This tool ensures the standardization and regulation of the table creation process, with scripts that automatically collect relevant metadata.
This framework significantly improved table management efficiency, optimized data accessibility, and provided insights into business logic.
Query Log Cost Analysis and Optimization:

To optimize costs, I used the Databricks API to collect daily query execution information from the platform. This included:

Estimating the cost of each query and creating a foundational Query Log table to store the data.
Regularly optimizing high-cost queries through SQL tuning, which led to reduced platform operating costs.
Query Behavior Analysis and Process Optimization:

Based on the Query Log table, I analyzed the queries to extract details such as the tables and users involved in each query. The optimization process included:

Analyzing table usage frequency and mapping it to actual business use cases.
Performing in-depth optimizations at both the table and data process levels, resulting in improved overall system performance and efficiency.
